  <b>DSMovie</b> is a project developed during Spring React 4.0 Week, held by the <b><a href="https://devsuperior.com.br/">DevSuperior</a></b> programming school. During Spring React Week we developed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> API in Spring Boot using the Java programming language and Front-end using React. After the event, I decided to add to the project an application developed in Firemonkey, using Object Pascal, which will be compatible with Windows, macOS, iOS and Android platforms.
